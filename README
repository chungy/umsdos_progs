Ok, the bump from version 0.10 to 1.11 is not of some kind of "great release
full of changes" (although it does contain few fixes), but just to make it
clear that 0.10 was actually newer than 0.9. With 1.11 there will hopefully
be no such confusion.

Big rewrite by Matija Nalis <mnalis@jagor.srce.hr> is in progress.

(note: it no longer requires C++ for utils [as of 0.10]. tests/ is still
C++.  This is still being ironed out, so please have patience with CVS until
release. Thanks. Also note that it does not compile yet, parts which compile
are buggy and everything is full of glibc/kernel clashes and remnants of
C++. Docs (also remaining of this and other README's) are also completely
outdated. tests/ is still C++. It is all being fixed. Feel free to send
patches. Thanks for you patience.)

please edit include/ums_config.h prior to 'make all' in topdir!
This is essential !

Also note that you will need full kernel tree (not just includes) to compile
utilities (it needs linux/fs/umsdos/mangle.c)

recent information about UMSDOS can be found at 
http://www.voyager.hr/~mnalis/umsdos/

If you are getting UMSDOS_STAT_DOS errors while umssync-ing, please
see a patches there.

This stuff is written by Jacques Gelinas (jacques@solucorp.qc.ca).
Comments are welcome.

This is the distribution of the UMSDOS file system utilities.
There is two directories.

util: contain administration tool for umsdos and man page.

tests: Contain regression tests for both umsdos and msdos file system

To build this distribution, do


	make all

To install (this will put few programs in /sbin)

	make install

To clean object files

	make clean

To test umsdos, here is the sequence I do.

	cd tests
	# mount0 assume that drive F: is your floppy B:
	# I use this trick to do mformat
	make mount0
	utstgen all
	umount /mnt
	utstspc all

To learn about umsdos (internal) get the file umsdos-x.y-doc.gz
from sunsite.unc.edu in pub/Linux/ALPHA/umsdos. See also
the README in /usr/src/linux/fs/umsdos.
