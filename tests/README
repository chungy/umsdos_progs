tests/ are being modified to work with 2.2.x kernels (some things changed,
for example maximal symlink depth, and ability to do 'rmdir .' etc). See
#define KERN_22X in include/ums_config.h and change it accordingly). Please
not that some tests (for example ones including mknod(2) or chown(2) need
root priviledges)

Currently (990626), tests should be passable in 2.2.10 kernel for utstgen
running over ext2 filesystem. 


utstgen over umsdos currently (kernel 2.2.10 + Viro's FAT-patch-20 -- get it
from ftp://ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/) passes all utstgen tests except:

gen/hlink.C/hlink_simple: Simple hard link operations
gen/rename.C/rename_exist: Rename a file and the target exists
gen/time.C/time_simple: Simple operation to change the time stamp of files

utstspc is broken currently (wants prehistoric mtools)
(corrected to find and new mtools 990701, but haven't tried if it passes any
tests yet. stay tuned...)
